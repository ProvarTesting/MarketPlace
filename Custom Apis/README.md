# MarketPlace

Provar's Marketplace is an open source public repository for anyone who has solved a specific business problem and wants to share with the Provar community any code, how-to tips or settings for Test Automation.

The contributions by Provar employees are made as is and you are free to use these at your own discretion. No support is provided by any of the authors of the marketplace content, these should be treated as useful examples and you should apply your own development practices to verify if you wish to use them in your application lifecycle.

We hope you find this repo useful and welcome contributions from all our customers and partners to grow the collection of re-usable PageObjects, Page Controls, Strategy files, reusable (callable) test cases or test plans.
