# MarketPlace PageObject Files
Use this directory to submit your PageObject files. 
We recommend you name them consistently according to the web page they have been created for.

A page object is a test artifact that holds the details of all the elements on a web page that might
be involved in an automated test. Provar PageObjects are a pattern for encapsulating reusable locators. 
In Provar PageObjects are automatically created for you when you map a previously unidentified field
on a previously unmapped page or page component. You can also create your own page objects or extend
those page objects with customm PO Operations for more complex processing or where complex logic is
required to identify a field or take a specific action.
